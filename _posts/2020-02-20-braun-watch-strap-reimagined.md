<h4> The Strap: </h4>
<br>
**Magnetic Band made of 30 super strong N52 Neodymium Magnets:**<br>
- Super easy to put on and satisfyingly simple to adjust. <br>
- The magnets give the strap a high-quality weight and a refined look on the leather. <br>
- Minimalist design *without buckle* <br>
- The strap only needs *one loop*, in order not to move to the sides. The two straps stay flat on top of each other due to the magnets. The loop jumps easily onto the strap and stays in place due to a hidden magnet. <br>
- When not worn, the strap holds together on its own. The strong magnets are not at the back of the watch. In its place there is only a very light magnetic strap, in order not to stick to the watch case itself.  
- BONUS: Magnets are very nice to fidget with<br>
<br>
<br>
**Selected leather with minimalist design:** <br>
- For the upper leather, I chose a clean black leather.
- The yellow leather on the back peaks through slightly at the back and sides.
- The red loop serves the strap with a second colour accent.
- The strap is not rounded at the ends. This makes it look a little bit more modern and lets the yellow leather peak through a bit more.
- The sides are polished, so that the leather fibres of the different types of leather join into one. 
- All types of leather are selected with a special emphasis on [transparency](https://www.gusti-leder.de/transparente-produktion-de/at/ch), [sustainability](https://www.gusti-leder.de/nachhaltigkeit-de) and [prevention of child labour](https://www.gusti-leder.de/inspiration/die-welt-von-gusti/gegen-kinderarbeit/)

<h4>The Story behind: </h4>
<br>
At home on christmas I found this old Braun watch looking through a drawer. It had no strap on it and was not running. I did some research and they don’t build it like that anymore, but I believe it’s an AW20 designed by Dietrich Lubs in 1994. It has the silver dial and a Ronda 715 movement.<br>
I always liked the iconic, clean design of Braun Products that made Dieter Rams famous, but I think they can look a little bit bland with the normal black watch strap. <br>
So I started with the mission of making it look a little bit more modern and young, without losing any of the timeless design. What makes Braun watches so intriguing and recognizable are these small accents in color. The watch has the traditional yellow second hand and the red arrow pointing at the date window. <br>
I didn’t find anything on the internet, so I decided to build it myself. The way I would want it, reproducing the nice accents and details and giving the design a little bit of an update. I went through multiple iterations and improvements until I finished this final version.
