<h4>Building Process:</h4>
<br>
**1) The Idea**<br>
The Design started as an armchair. I liked the idea of having a design, as simple as two squares with a seating surface in between. After finding the original sketch again, I decided to actually build it. 
<br>

<br>
<br>
**2) The Frame**<br>
Then came the sketch for slightly altered stool, which I decided to build using of the shelf pipes. Lucky enough they have perfect dimensions for a stool. I filed off the threads of three of the pipes to put it together.

<br>
**3) The Fabric**<br>
For testing of the seat I used canvas and a stapler to get an impression for what kind of fabric at what length I needed. 
<br>
I decided to use a clean base fabric thatâ€™s strong and can be combined with custom covers or pillows, so they could be put on there easily, no matter the nature of their fabric. Having the final fabric I once more tested for the right length by using velcro straps glued to the back.
<br>
Finally, I sewed it together. Now it's a simple loop of fabric sewed together at the back.

<h4>Exploring the Design</h4>
<br>
Exploring options for the stool I discovered how versatile the original design was and so I began sketching an entire series of furniture with it all based on two simple connected rectangles. They now include a table, a sideboard, an armchair, the stool, and a bed.
<br>
Futhermore they can all be done in black for a cleaner look. 
<br>
<br>
Last but not least, there is a list of improvements and ideas for a second version of the stool, which I didn't get around to make yet and tons of really exciting research and ideas for a bigger project about modular furniture I would like to get to.
