<h4>Building Process:</h4>
<br>
**1) The Idea**<br>
The Design started as an armchair. I liked the idea of having a design, as simple as two squares with a seating surface in between. After finding the original sketch again, I decided to actually build it. 
<br>

<br>
<br>
**2) The Frame**<br>
Then came the sketch for slightly altered stool, which I decided to build using of the shelf pipes. Lucky enough they have perfect dimensions for a stool. I filed off the threads of three of the pipes to put it together.

<br>
**3) The Fabric**<br>
For testing of the seat I used canvas and a stapler to get an impression for what kind of fabric at what length I needed. 
<br>
I decided to use a clean base fabric that’s strong and can be combined with custom covers or pillows, so they could be put on there easily, no matter the nature of their fabric. Having the final fabric I once more tested for the right length by using velcro straps glued to the back.
<br>
Finally, I sewed it together. Now it's a simple loop of fabric sewed together at the back.

<h4>Exploring the Design</h4>
<br>
Exploring options for the stool I discovered how versatile the original design was and so I began sketching an entire series of furniture with it all based on two simple connected rectangles. They now include a table, a sideboard, an armchair, the stool, and a bed.
<br>
Futhermore they can all be done in black for a cleaner look. 
<br>
<br>
Last but not least, there is a list of improvements and ideas for a second version of the stool, which I didn't get around to make yet and tons of really exciting research and ideas for a bigger project about modular furniture I would like to get to.
